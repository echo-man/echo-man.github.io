	<section class="about">
		<p>I am a learner and reader, both for fun and work. I have strong passion to teach and discuss with others (I had opportunities to teach my colleagues) and always trying to learn new things without unlearn old techniques.</p>
		<p>I have adequate skills in academic and scientific document creation and its typesetting (mostly in LaTeX and LyX), cartography, geological modeling, geostatistics and geoscience applications using both proprietary and open source softwares.</p>
		<p>To keep pace with latest web and app technologies, I always push myself to learn how to code. I have good basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jade, Sass, Coffeescript, Git, Rails, Jekyll, Bootstrap, Foundation, Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, Refills, Cordova, PhoneGap, Corel Draw and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

						<h1><a href="">Websites</a></h1>
						<p>A website is a unique way to communicate with the world. The internet is a rich and dynamic media that's ready to be exploited. Websites are the most important communications tool and a powerful marketing ally. </p>
						<p>Placement or arrangement of visual elements, usually known as composition, is basically how those elements organized on a page. Now it's a common practice for designers to use a grid structure to help them position items on a page.</p>
						<p> <strong>BETTER ANSWERS  </strong>is an example of how I designed and created a responsive website using Foundation's grid system. By using this grid system, it is easier for me to add new content to the website in a consistent way. Similar responsive results also gained by using Bootstrap, Neat, 960 Grid System and others CSS frameworks, or by using media queries, so the design can adapt to changes in screen resolution and viewport dimensions.   </p><small class="tags"><span class="tag">Grids</span><span class="tag">CSS Frameworks</span><span class="tag">Responsive</span></small>

						<h1><a href="">MVC - Ruby on Rails</a></h1>
						<p>Did I mention that I love Quora? Quora's community contains famous and prolific investors, entrepreneurs, and creative thinkers who have shaped and are still shaping the way humans interact with the web. That's why I created mockup forum using Ruby on Rails based on my Quora answers. This mockup forum enable you to sign-up, sign-in, create, edit and delete thread/post and its comments. All of this are made possible by Ruby on Rails and Codio (awesome cloud-based code editor).</p>
						<p>Ruby on Rails is often promoted as an MVC web framework. In Ruby on Rails, model data gets sent to the views via the controller, and it is the controller that returns the HTML output back to the browser. </p><small class="tags"><span class="tag">Ruby on Rails</span><span class="tag">Model</span><span class="tag">Viewer</span><span class="tag">Controller</span></small>

						<h1><a href="">Blog - Vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript</a></h1>
						<p>There are various genre of writing. I'm not sure which genre is perfectly fit for me, but regardless of that, I have a burning passion in writing. I'm not saying that my writing is outstanding (still working up on that), but one for sure, by writing I can pour my obscure ideas into its discrete forms, test my skill in storytelling and gained commentaries from readers. </p>
						<p>Satisfaction in writing is doubled by ability to construct the blog / website itself using technologies I know and love: HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's really make my days.</p><small class="tags"><span class="tag">Vanilla</span><span class="tag">HTML</span><span class="tag">CSS</span><span class="tag">Javascript</span></small>

						<h1><a href="">Blog - Jekyll</a></h1>
						<p>Jekyll is a website generator, written in Ruby. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, such as Markdown (or Textile), or HTML, and runs those files through converters, then generates a static HTML website that can be hosted on a web server.</p>
						<p>One of the main reasons to use Jekyll is its simplicity. The goal of Jekyll was to eliminate the complexity of other blogging platforms by creating a workflow that allows you to blog like a hacker. No kidding.</p>
						<p>Jekyll makes it easy to create your templating system for pages and blog-post, then compile the whole stuff to purely static HTML files. Host your compiled stuffs wherever you like and you're good to go. No need for any script side language (no PHP) and no database connection (no MySQL) making Jekyll is light and self-sufficient.</p><small class="tags"><span class="tag">Jekyll</span><span class="tag">Web Generator</span><span class="tag">Static</span><span class="tag">Blog</span></small>

						<h1><a href="">Blog - Wordpress</a></h1>
						<p>WordPress is the most popular open source Content Management System (CMS) used in approximately 73 million websites. It is free to install, deploy, and upgrade. Thousands of plugins and templates power a flexible and simple interface, which reduces cost and deployment time. </p>
						<p>I'm writing blog since 2008 using WordPress, because at that time (and still resonate strongly today), WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world, giving room for expansion, highly customizable, designed for anyone (not just developers) and has lower setup and maintenance cost.</p>
						<p>Today, I'm hooked in static web generator like Jekyll or Octopress, not because it's the best way to blog, but it's the most suitable platform for my preferences. Several designers and web developer still produce fantastic websites using CMS as their tool of trades.</p><small class="tags"><span class="tag">Wordpress</span><span class="tag">CMS</span><span class="tag">Dynamic</span><span class="tag">Blog</span></small>

						<h1><a href="">Fully operational Research Catalogue mockup App</a></h1>
						<p>Why would you want an app when you already have a brochure and a website? Smartphone is the number one means of communication. Apps are especially developed for smartphones and therefore function much better than a mobile website, no matter how responsive. Compared to a website or print advertising, apps are not expensive at all. </p>

						<h1><a href="">Thesis</a></h1>
						<p>Using LaTeX or its front-end, LyX, to write thesis is an unique experience.

						<h1><a href="">Thesis presentation</a></h1>
						<p>As a challenge to myself and as a test-proof to measure my knowledge in web development, I made my thesis results presentation as a web, without using Powerpoint. </p>
						<p>I was the only master student (as far as I know) who aren't using PowerPoint in presenting thesis results and that made me truly stand-out. It was a definite differentiator. The web presentation isn't perfect and need to be revised but it make me feel like an outlier (in a positive way). </p><small class="tags"><span class="tag">Presentation</span><span class="tag">Thesis</span><span class="tag">Master</span><span class="tag">HTML</span><span class="tag">CSS</span><span class="tag">Javascript</span></small>

						<h1><a href="">Research papers</a></h1>
						<p>LaTeX / LyX are good for anyone who is writing non-trivial documents such as research papers and is tired of being let down by the performance of the current crop of word processors. </p>
						<p>Using LaTeX / LyX will result in world-class mathematical content (via a fully integrated equation editor) and structured documents. In addition, staples of scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation come as a built-in standard.</p>
						<!--p By the way, research papers has always sent a mixed message. You’re supposed to be original, but must quote someone else to back up every point you make - while in constant fear that you’ll be accused of stealing from them.
